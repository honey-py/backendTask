This is a repo which contains answers to the questions asked in backend task in web dev sig in ieee.
I tried to minimize the usage of prebuilt functions which could solve the problem in seconds for the sake of this task.
Still some bare minimum difficulty level prebuilt functoins like min, sort, etc might be used by me but to a very limited extent.
I have also added comments for your ease at places where I handle some errors and other things.
I might have overdone some of these by thinking out of what question asked and trying to handle every possible case and error but I hope that won't be an issue.
I hope you like my answers! ðŸ˜Š
Edit: I wasn't able to do all questions because of time constraint (I'm currently attending every class). And I didn't use chatgpt, believe me! If I did, I could do this in 5 minutes. But the q2 took me hours and still coudn't do it, probably 'cause of jee (2 years away from computer). Please consider the other answers
