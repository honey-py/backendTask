This is the repo which contains answers to the questions asked in backend task in web dev sig in ieee.
I tried to minimize the usage of prebuilt functions which could solve the problem in seconds for the sake of this task.
Still some bare minimum difficulty level prebuilt functoins like min, sort, etc could be used by me but to a very limited extent.
I have also added comments for your reading at places where I handle some errors and some other things.
I might have overdone some of these by thinking out of what question asked and trying to handle every possible case and error but I hope that won't be an issue.
I hope you like my answers! ðŸ˜Š
